# ADR-009: Debate Agents

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: CodeForge AI needs improved reasoning accuracy for complex decisions in Phase 1, as single-agent solutions often miss edge cases and fail to consider alternative approaches. Research shows multi-agent debate reduces hallucinations by 30-40% and improves solution quality for architectural decisions.

**Decision**: Implement 3-agent debate system using LangGraph v0.5.3+ subgraphs with specialized roles (proponent, opponent, moderator) in Phase 1, extending to 5-agent configuration in Phase 2.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Significant improvement in decision quality, reduced hallucinations, better consideration of trade-offs, natural extension to complex scenarios in Phase 2
- Negative: Increased computational cost, higher latency for complex decisions, coordination complexity, potential for debate loops

## Architecture Overview

### 3-Agent Debate System (Phase 1)

- **Proponent Agent**: Argues for proposed solution with supporting evidence and best practices
- **Opponent Agent**: Identifies risks, limitations, and alternative approaches
- **Moderator Agent**: Synthesizes arguments, weighs trade-offs, and makes final decision
- **Round Limitation**: Maximum 2 rounds to balance quality with efficiency
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Confidence-based decision making with quality thresholds

### Debate Trigger Conditions

- **High Complexity Tasks**: System architecture, performance optimization, security decisions
- **Uncertain Outcomes**: When initial solution confidence <0.75
- **Critical Decisions**: Production deployments, major refactoring, API design
- **User Request**: Explicit request for thorough analysis

### Quality Assurance Process

- **Evidence Validation**: Arguments must cite specific examples, documentation, or patterns
- **Bias Detection**: Monitor for confirmation bias and echo chamber effects
- **Time Management**: Structured rounds with defined time limits
- **Decision Tracking**: Audit trail of arguments and decision rationale

## Debate Orchestration

### Role Specialization

- **Proponent Focus**: Solution benefits, implementation feasibility, alignment with requirements
- **Opponent Focus**: Potential risks, maintenance burden, alternative solutions, edge cases
- **Moderator Focus**: Objective analysis, trade-off evaluation, stakeholder impact assessment

### Round Management

- **Round 1**: Initial positions and primary arguments
- **Round 2**: Counter-arguments and refinement based on opponent feedback
- **Synthesis**: Moderator analysis and final decision with confidence score
- **Early Termination**: Stop if strong consensus (>90% confidence) reached

### Implementation Architecture

```pseudocode
DebateOrchestrator {
  participants: [ProponentAgent, OpponentAgent, ModeratorAgent]
  maxRounds: 2  // Phase 1 constraint
  consensusThreshold: 0.75
  evidenceRequirement: true
  
  runDebate(proposal, context) -> DebateDecision {
    debate = initializeDebate(proposal, context)
    
    for round in 1..maxRounds {
      proponentArgs = proponent.argue(proposal, debate.history)
      opponentArgs = opponent.critique(proposal, proponentArgs, debate.history)
      
      synthesis = moderator.synthesize(proponentArgs, opponentArgs, context)
      debate.addRound(round, proponentArgs, opponentArgs, synthesis)
      
      if (synthesis.confidence > consensusThreshold) {
        return synthesis.decision
      }
      
      proposal = refineProposal(proposal, synthesis.recommendations)
    }
    
    return moderator.finalDecision(debate)
  }
}

DebateQuality {
  evidenceValidator: EvidenceChecker
  biasDetector: BiasAnalyzer
  qualityMetrics: QualityTracker
  
  validateArgument(argument) -> ValidationResult
  detectBias(argumentSet) -> BiasReport
  scoreDebateQuality(debate) -> QualityScore
}
```

## Phase 2 Extensions

### 5-Agent Configuration

- **Additional Roles**: User Advocate (usability focus), Technical Critic (implementation focus)
- **Extended Rounds**: Up to 3 rounds for complex architectural decisions
- **Specialized Expertise**: Domain-specific knowledge injection per agent
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Weighted voting and sophisticated agreement mechanisms

### Advanced Features

- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Agent specialization based on task domain
- **Parallel Debates**: Multiple concurrent debates for different aspects
- **Hierarchical Decisions**: Sub-debates for complex multi-part decisions
- **Learning Integration**: Debate outcomes inform future routing decisions

## Success Criteria

### Quality Improvements

- **Decision Accuracy**: 30-40% improvement over single-agent baseline
- **Hallucination Reduction**: <5% factual errors in final decisions (vs 15% baseline)
- **Trade-off Analysis**: 85% of decisions include explicit trade-off consideration
- **Edge Case Coverage**: 70% improvement in identifying potential failure modes
- **Solution Robustness**: 50% fewer production issues from debate-validated decisions

### Performance Targets

- **Debate Latency**: <60s for complete 3-agent debate (2 rounds)
- **Consensus Rate**: 80% of debates reach consensus within 2 rounds
- **Escalation Rate**: <10% of decisions require human review
- **Resource Efficiency**: <3x cost overhead vs single-agent decision making

### Process Metrics

- **Evidence Quality**: >90% of arguments include verifiable evidence or citations
- **Bias Detection**: <5% bias incidents detected per debate session
- **Moderator Accuracy**: 95% agreement between moderator decisions and expert review
- **Time Management**: 98% of debates complete within allocated time limits

# ADR-013: Extended Debate

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Phase 2 of CodeForge AI requires more sophisticated reasoning for complex architectural decisions, system designs, and high-stakes technical choices. While 3-agent debate provides good results, 5-agent configuration enables deeper analysis with specialized perspectives for critical decisions requiring comprehensive evaluation.

**Decision**: Extend debate system to 5 agents using LangGraph v0.5.3+ with specialized roles (proponent, opponent, advocate, critic, moderator) and up to 3 rounds for complex Phase 2 scenarios, maintaining compatibility with Phase 1 3-agent system.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Higher quality decisions for complex scenarios, more comprehensive perspective coverage, specialized expertise injection, better stakeholder representation
- Negative: Increased latency and computational cost, more complex coordination, potential for analysis paralysis, higher token consumption

## Architecture Overview

### 5-Agent Role Specialization

- **Proponent**: Advocates for proposed solution with technical evidence
- **Opponent**: Identifies risks, limitations, and alternative approaches  
- **Advocate**: Represents user/stakeholder perspectives and practical concerns
- **Critic**: Provides objective technical analysis and quality assessment
- **Moderator**: Synthesizes all perspectives and facilitates consensus building

### Enhanced Debate Structure

- **Extended Rounds**: Up to 3 rounds for complex architectural decisions
- **Parallel Initial Phase**: Simultaneous argument development for efficiency
- **Sequential Refinement**: Structured response and counter-response phases
- **Consensus Building**: Sophisticated agreement mechanisms with weighted input

### Debate Complexity Triggers

- **System Architecture**: Major design decisions affecting multiple components
- **Performance Critical**: Decisions with significant performance implications
- **Security Sensitive**: Changes affecting system security posture
- **High Stakes**: Production deployments or major refactoring decisions
- **Multi-Stakeholder**: Decisions affecting various user groups or teams

## Enhanced Orchestration

### Dynamic Role Assignment

- **Domain Expertise**: Select agents based on specialized knowledge areas
- **Stakeholder Representation**: Ensure relevant perspectives are included
- **Technical Focus**: Adjust technical depth based on decision complexity
- **Time Constraints**: Balance thoroughness with decision timeline requirements

### Parallel Processing Optimization

- **Initial Arguments**: Proponent, opponent, advocate, and critic work simultaneously
- **Evidence Gathering**: Parallel research and fact-checking across agents
- **Perspective Development**: Independent viewpoint formation before interaction
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduce overall debate time through parallelization

### Implementation Architecture

```pseudocode
ExtendedDebateOrchestrator {
  participants: [Proponent, Opponent, Advocate, Critic, Moderator]
  maxRounds: 3  // Phase 2 extension
  consensusThreshold: 0.8  // Higher threshold for complex decisions
  specialization: DomainExpertise
  
  runExtendedDebate(proposal, context) -> DebateDecision {
    assignSpecializations(participants, context.domain)
    debate = initializeExtendedDebate(proposal, context)
    
    // Parallel initial phase
    initialArguments = runParallelPhase(participants[0:4], proposal)
    
    for round in 1..maxRounds {
      refinedArguments = refineArguments(initialArguments, round)
      synthesis = moderator.synthesize(refinedArguments, context)
      
      if (synthesis.confidence > consensusThreshold) {
        return synthesis.decision
      }
      
      if (round < maxRounds) {
        proposal = moderator.refineProposal(proposal, synthesis)
        initialArguments = updateArguments(refinedArguments, proposal)
      }
    }
    
    return moderator.finalDecision(debate)
  }
}

SpecializationManager {
  expertiseDomains: Map<Domain, List<AgentCapability>>
  roleAssignment: DynamicAssignment
  
  assignSpecializations(agents, domain) {
    for agent in agents {
      expertise = expertiseDomains[domain]
      agent.setSpecialization(expertise)
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Consensus Mechanisms

### Weighted Decision Making

- **Expertise Weighting**: Higher weight for agents with relevant domain knowledge
- **Confidence Scoring**: Factor in each agent's confidence in their assessment
- **Evidence Quality**: Weight arguments based on supporting evidence strength
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Consider breadth of impact on different user groups

### Multi-Criteria Evaluation

- **Technical Merit**: Code quality, performance, maintainability
- **Business Value**: User impact, development velocity, cost implications
- **Risk Assessment**: Security, reliability, and operational considerations
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Timeline, resource requirements, complexity

### Conflict Resolution

- **Structured Negotiation**: Formal process for resolving disagreements
- **Evidence-Based Resolution**: Require supporting data for contentious points
- **Compromise Identification**: Find middle-ground solutions when possible
- **Escalation Protocols**: Human expert involvement for unresolved conflicts

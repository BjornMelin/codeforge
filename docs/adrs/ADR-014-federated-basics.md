# ADR-014: Federated Basics

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Phase 2 of CodeForge AI requires privacy-preserving collaboration capabilities for teams working across organizations or security boundaries. Traditional centralized approaches expose sensitive code and data, while federated learning enables collaborative improvement while maintaining data privacy and regulatory compliance.

**Decision**: Implement federated learning basics using Flower v1.12.1+ framework with differential privacy and secure aggregation for collaborative model improvement while maintaining strict data isolation and privacy controls.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Enables privacy-preserving collaboration, regulatory compliance, knowledge sharing without data exposure, improved models through collaborative learning
- Negative: Increased architecture complexity, coordination overhead, need for cryptographic protocols, potential communication latency

## Architecture Overview

### Federated Learning Fundamentals

- **Decentralized Training**: Local model training on private data at each node
- **Secure Aggregation**: Cryptographically secure combination of model updates
- **Differential Privacy**: Mathematical privacy guarantees for individual data points
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Share learned patterns without exposing raw data

### Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms

- **Data Isolation**: No raw data leaves organizational boundaries
- **Gradient Protection**: Differential privacy noise injection for gradient updates
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted channels for all federated communications
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for federated participation

### Collaboration Patterns

- **Model Improvement**: Collaborative enhancement of code generation models
- **Pattern Sharing**: Exchange of architectural patterns without exposing specifics
- **Benchmark Aggregation**: Privacy-safe performance metric sharing
- **Best Practice Distribution**: Share coding standards while maintaining confidentiality

## Federated Architecture

### Node Classification

- **Coordinating Node**: Manages federated learning rounds and aggregation
- **Participating Nodes**: Local CodeForge instances contributing to federation
- **Passive Nodes**: Benefit from federated insights without contributing
- **Specialized Nodes**: Domain-specific expertise nodes (security, performance, etc.)

### Communication Protocol

- **Round-Based Learning**: Structured learning cycles with global coordination
- **Asynchronous Updates**: Support for nodes with different availability patterns
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Efficient model update compression and transmission
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful handling of node failures and network issues

### Implementation Architecture

```pseudocode
FederatedManager {
  flowerClient: FlowerFramework
  privacyEngine: DifferentialPrivacy
  secureAggregator: CryptographicAggregation
  localModel: CodeForgeModel
  
  participateInRound(roundConfig) -> ModelUpdate {
    localData = getPrivateTrainingData()
    
    // Local training with privacy protection
    modelUpdate = localModel.train(localData)
    noisyUpdate = privacyEngine.addNoise(modelUpdate, roundConfig.epsilon)
    
    // Secure transmission
    encryptedUpdate = secureAggregator.encrypt(noisyUpdate)
    return transmitUpdate(encryptedUpdate)
  }
  
  receiveGlobalModel(aggregatedModel) {
    // Verify authenticity and apply updates
    verifiedModel = secureAggregator.verify(aggregatedModel)
    localModel.updateFromFederated(verifiedModel)
    
    // Update local capabilities
    updateLocalPerformance(verifiedModel)
  }
}

PrivacyController {
  epsilonBudget: Float  // Differential privacy budget
  noiseCalibration: NoiseCalibrator
  privacyAuditor: PrivacyTracker
  
  enforcePrivacyConstraints(data, operation) -> PrivacyResult {
    requiredEpsilon = calculateEpsilon(operation)
    
    if (epsilonBudget < requiredEpsilon) {
      return PrivacyResult.BUDGET_EXHAUSTED
    }
    
    noise = noiseCalibration.generateNoise(requiredEpsilon)
    epsilonBudget -= requiredEpsilon
    
    return PrivacyResult.APPROVED(noise)
  }
}
```

## Privacy Protection Mechanisms

### Differential Privacy Implementation

- **Epsilon Budget Management**: Careful allocation of privacy budget across operations
- **Noise Calibration**: Mathematically proven noise levels for privacy guarantees
- **Composition Tracking**: Monitor cumulative privacy loss across multiple operations
- **Adaptive Mechanisms**: Adjust privacy parameters based on data sensitivity

### Secure Aggregation Protocols

- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Enable computation on encrypted model updates
- **Secret Sharing**: Distribute trust across multiple aggregation nodes
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Protect against malicious or compromised nodes
- **Verification Mechanisms**: Cryptographic proofs of aggregation correctness

### Data Minimization Strategies

- **Gradient Compression**: Reduce information leakage through update compression
- **Selective Sharing**: Choose which model components to include in federation
- **Temporal Isolation**: Limit federation participation to specific time windows
- **Purpose Limitation**: Restrict federated learning to specific use cases

## Success Criteria

### Privacy Guarantees

- **Differential Privacy**: ε-differential privacy with ε ≤ 1.0 for all operations
- **Data Isolation**: Zero raw data transmission across organizational boundaries

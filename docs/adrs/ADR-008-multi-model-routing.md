# ADR-008: Multi-Model Routing

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: CodeForge AI requires dynamic model selection for optimal accuracy, performance, and cost in Phase 1. Different LLMs excel at different tasks - some for reasoning, others for code generation. Must achieve 25% performance improvement through specialization while maintaining <$100/month cost budget with intelligent routing.

**Decision**: OpenRouter dynamic routing with task-based model selection: Grok-4 (~40% complex reasoning), Claude-4 (~30% code gen), Kimi K2 (~20% general), Gemini Flash (~10% quick queries), o3 (<5% specialized tasks).

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Optimal model selection per task type, significant cost savings through efficient routing, improved output quality, access to latest models without vendor lock-in
- Negative: Routing complexity, need for task classification, potential inconsistency across models, dependency on OpenRouter service

## Architecture Overview

### Model Specialization Strategy

- **Grok-4**: Complex reasoning, architectural decisions, system design
- **Claude-4**: Code generation, refactoring, documentation writing
- **Kimi K2**: General-purpose tasks, rapid prototyping, simple queries
- **Gemini Flash**: Quick responses, simple questions, low-latency needs
- **o3**: Specialized mathematical reasoning, algorithm optimization

### Routing Decision Factors

- **Task Complexity**: Simple/medium/high classification based on keywords and context
- **Response Time Requirements**: Real-time vs batch processing needs
- **Cost Constraints**: Budget allocation and spend tracking per model
- **Quality Requirements**: Accuracy needs vs speed trade-offs
- **Context Length**: Token limits and context window optimization

### Dynamic Routing Logic

- **Task Classification**: Automatic categorization of incoming requests
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time success rate and quality monitoring
- **Cost Optimization**: Dynamic budget allocation based on task importance
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation when preferred models unavailable

## Routing Architecture

### Task Classification Engine

- **Complexity Analysis**: Keyword density, technical depth, architectural scope
- **Intent Recognition**: Code generation, debugging, explanation, research
- **Context Assessment**: Conversation history and accumulated context
- **Quality Requirements**: User expectations and task criticality

### Performance Monitoring

- **Success Rate Tracking**: Per-model accuracy and completion rates
- **Latency Monitoring**: Response time distribution by model and task type
- **Cost Analysis**: Real-time spend tracking and budget optimization
- **Quality Metrics**: User feedback and automated quality assessment

    trackDecision(request, selectedModel, analysis)
    return selectedModel
  }
  
  scoreModels(analysis, models) -> ScoredCandidates {
    for model in models {

        latency: model.averageLatency,
        cost: model.costPerToken,
        availability: model.currentLoad

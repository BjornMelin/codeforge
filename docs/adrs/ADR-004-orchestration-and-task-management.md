# ADR-004: Orchestration and Task Management

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: CodeForge AI requires dynamic workflow orchestration and task coordination in Phase 1, scalable to Phase 2 extended agents. Needs to handle complex agent coordination, task distribution, and workflow management while maintaining low latency and high reliability. Must support 3-agent debate flows in Phase 1 and scale to 5-agent configurations in Phase 2.

**Decision**: LangGraph v0.5.3+ graphs with hybrid in-memory deque + Redis v6.0.0+ Pub/Sub for task management in Phase 1, extending to 5-agent support in Phase 2.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Low-latency task processing, 30% improvement in coordination efficiency, rich workflow definition capabilities, scalable to Phase 2 requirements, built-in state persistence
- Negative: Increased architectural complexity, need for Redis infrastructure, synchronization overhead between in-memory and persistent task queues

## Architecture Overview

### Hybrid Task Management

- **In-Memory Queue**: Ultra-low latency task assignment using deque structures
- **Redis Persistence**: Durable task storage and cross-instance coordination
- **Priority Handling**: Critical tasks bypass normal queue ordering
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic task dependency resolution and activation

### Agent Coordination Strategy

- **Capability-Based Assignment**: Match tasks to agents based on skills and availability
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute tasks across available agents optimally
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor agent effectiveness and adjust assignments
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic task reassignment on agent failure

### Workflow Orchestration

- **LangGraph Integration**: StateGraph-based workflow definitions
- **Conditional Routing**: Dynamic workflow paths based on task analysis
- **Debate Workflows**: Specialized 3-agent debate orchestration
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry and workflow continuation mechanisms

## Debate Coordination Architecture

### 3-Agent Debate System (Phase 1)

- **Proponent Agent**: Argues for proposed solution with supporting evidence
- **Opponent Agent**: Identifies risks and counterarguments
- **Moderator Agent**: Synthesizes arguments and makes final decision
- **Round Management**: Maximum 2 rounds for efficiency
- **Consensus Tracking**: Confidence scoring and decision validation

### 5-Agent Extension (Phase 2)

- **Additional Roles**: Advocate (user perspective), Critic (technical perspective)
- **Extended Rounds**: Up to 3 rounds for complex decisions
- **Specialization**: Domain-specific agent expertise
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Sophisticated agreement mechanisms

### Implementation Architecture

```pseudocode
TaskOrchestrator {
  inMemoryQueue: PriorityDeque<Task>
  persistentQueue: Redis
  agentPool: Map<AgentID, AgentCapabilities>
  activeWorkflows: Map<WorkflowID, LangGraphInstance>
  
  submitTask(task) -> TaskID {
    if (task.priority == CRITICAL) {
      inMemoryQueue.pushFront(task)
    } else {
      inMemoryQueue.pushBack(task)
    }
    
    persistentQueue.store(task)
    notifyAvailableAgents(task)
    return task.id
  }
  
  assignNextTask(agentID) -> Task {
    task = findBestMatch(agentID, inMemoryQueue)
    if (task) {
      task.assignedAgent = agentID
      moveToRunning(task)
      return task
    }
    return null
  }
}

DebateOrchestrator {
  participants: List<AgentRole>
  maxRounds: Integer
  consensusThreshold: Float
  
  runDebate(proposal) -> Decision {
    for round in 1..maxRounds {
      arguments = collectArguments(participants, proposal)
      synthesis = moderatorAnalysis(arguments)
      
      if (consensusReached(synthesis)) {
        return synthesis.decision
      }
      
      proposal = refineProposal(proposal, arguments)
    }
    
    return finalDecision(synthesis)
  }
}

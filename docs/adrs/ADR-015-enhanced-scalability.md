# ADR-015: Enhanced Scalability

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Phase 2 of CodeForge AI requires horizontal scaling capabilities to handle increased load, larger teams, and more complex workflows. The Phase 1 single-instance architecture must evolve to support distributed deployments, auto-scaling, and high availability while maintaining performance and consistency.

**Decision**: Implement horizontal scaling architecture using Redis Cluster v6.0.0+ for distributed state, Docker/Kubernetes orchestration, auto-scaling based on demand, and distributed load balancing with health monitoring.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Supports larger teams and complex workflows, handles traffic spikes gracefully, improved availability and fault tolerance, cost optimization through auto-scaling
- Negative: Increased operational complexity, distributed systems challenges, need for sophisticated monitoring, higher infrastructure requirements

## Architecture Overview

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy

- **Stateless Application Tier**: Multiple CodeForge instances behind load balancers
- **Distributed State Management**: Redis Cluster for shared state and coordination
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and sharding for database operations
- **Message Queue Scaling**: Distributed task queues with partition management

### Auto-Scaling Mechanisms

- **Demand-Based Scaling**: Automatic instance creation based on queue depth and latency
- **Predictive Scaling**: ML-based demand forecasting for proactive scaling
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-sizing instances based on workload characteristics
- **Cost Management**: Intelligent scale-down during low-demand periods

### High Availability Design

- **Multi-Zone Deployment**: Distribution across availability zones for fault tolerance
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks and automatic failover
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed components
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality during partial outages

## Scaling Architecture

### Load Distribution

- **Application Load Balancing**: Intelligent routing based on instance health and capacity
- **Task Distribution**: Distributed queue management across multiple worker nodes
- **Database Load Balancing**: Read/write splitting with automatic failover
- **Cache Distribution**: Consistent hashing for distributed cache operations

### State Management

- **Shared State Isolation**: Separate stateful and stateless components
- **Session Affinity**: Maintain user sessions while enabling scaling
- **Consistency Models**: Eventual consistency for performance, strong consistency where required
- **State Replication**: Multi-region state replication for disaster recovery

  }
}

    }

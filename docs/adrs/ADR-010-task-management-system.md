# ADR-010: Task Management System

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: CodeForge AI requires sophisticated task coordination for multi-agent workflows in Phase 1, managing dependencies, priorities, and agent assignments efficiently. Must support complex workflows while maintaining low latency and high reliability for autonomous development processes.

**Decision**: LangGraph v0.5.3+ StateGraph with Redis v6.0.0+ Pub/Sub for persistent coordination, using priority queues and dependency resolution for optimal task distribution.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Efficient task distribution, automatic dependency management, persistent state across restarts, scalable to Phase 2 requirements, built-in workflow orchestration
- Negative: Increased infrastructure complexity, Redis dependency, need for sophisticated coordination logic

## Architecture Overview

### Task Lifecycle Management

- **Submission**: Validate, prioritize, and queue new tasks with dependency analysis
- **Scheduling**: Intelligent assignment based on agent capabilities and current load
- **Execution**: Monitor progress with timeout management and health checks
- **Completion**: Results validation, dependency resolution, and cleanup
- **Failure Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff and escalation

### Priority and Dependency System

- **Priority Levels**: Critical, High, Normal, Low with queue jumping for emergencies
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic activation when prerequisites complete
- **Parallel Execution**: Maximum parallelization while respecting dependencies
- **Deadline Management**: SLA tracking and escalation for time-critical tasks

### Agent Coordination Strategy

- **Capability Matching**: Assign tasks to agents with appropriate skills
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across available agents
- **Health Monitoring**: Track agent performance and availability
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Add/remove agents based on queue depth and demand

## Task Distribution Architecture

### Queue Management

- **Multi-Priority Queues**: Separate queues for different priority levels
- **Round-Robin with Weights**: Balanced serving across priority levels
- **Starvation Prevention**: Ensure low-priority tasks eventually execute
- **Batch Processing**: Group related tasks for efficiency

### Coordination Mechanisms

- **Pub/Sub Notifications**: Real-time task assignment and status updates
- **Distributed Locking**: Prevent race conditions in task assignment
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Detect failed agents and reassign tasks
- **State Synchronization**: Maintain consistency across distributed components

### Implementation Architecture

```pseudocode
TaskCoordinator {
  priorityQueues: Map<Priority, TaskQueue>
  dependencyGraph: DependencyResolver
  agentPool: AgentManager
  persistentStore: RedisStore
  
  submitTask(task) -> TaskID {
    validatedTask = validateTask(task)
    resolveDependencies(validatedTask)
    
    queue = priorityQueues[task.priority]
    queue.enqueue(validatedTask)
    
    persistentStore.save(validatedTask)
    notifyAvailableAgents(validatedTask)
    
    return validatedTask.id
  }
  
  assignNextTask(agentID) -> Task {
    agent = agentPool.getAgent(agentID)
    
    for priority in [CRITICAL, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW] {
      task = findCompatibleTask(agent, priorityQueues[priority])
      if (task && canExecute(task)) {
        assignTaskToAgent(task, agent)
        return task
      }
    }
    
    return null
  }
}

DependencyResolver {
  dependencyGraph: DirectedAcyclicGraph
  waitingTasks: Map<TaskID, Task>
  
  resolveDependencies(task) -> ResolutionResult
  checkCompletion(completedTaskID) -> List<ActivatedTasks>
  validateNoCycles(newTask) -> ValidationResult
}
```

## Workflow Integration

### LangGraph State Management

- **Workflow State**: Persistent state across workflow steps
- **Checkpointing**: Automatic state snapshots for recovery
- **Branch Management**: Handle conditional workflow paths
- **Error Recovery**: Resume workflows from last successful checkpoint

### Task Types and Patterns

- **Sequential Tasks**: Linear dependency chains
- **Parallel Tasks**: Independent tasks that can run concurrently
- **Fan-out/Fan-in**: Parallel processing with aggregation
- **Conditional Tasks**: Dynamic workflow paths based on results

## Success Criteria

- **Task Assignment Latency**: <50ms for task assignment to available agent
- **Queue Processing**: 1000+ tasks/minute sustained throughput
- **Dependency Resolution**: <10ms to resolve task dependencies
- **State Persistence**: <100ms to persist task state changes
- **Agent Coordination**: Support 20+ concurrent agents without bottlenecks

### Reliability Metrics

- **Task Completion Rate**: >99% of tasks complete successfully
- **Failure Recovery**: <30s to detect and reassign failed tasks
- **State Consistency**: Zero data loss during normal operations

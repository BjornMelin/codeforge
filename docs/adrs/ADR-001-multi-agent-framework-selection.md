# ADR-001: Multi-Agent Framework Selection

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: CodeForge AI requires flexible orchestration for hierarchical agents, debate mechanisms, and multi-model routing in Phase 1, with extensibility for Phase 2 multi-modal and federated features. The system needs to balance power with simplicity for autonomous workflows across phases while enabling complex agent coordination patterns including 3-agent debates scaling to 5-agent configurations.

**Decision**: Use LangGraph v0.5.3+ for graph-based, stateful orchestration in Phase 1, extending with subgraphs for Phase 2 features.

**Consequences**:

- Positive: Easy integration with LangSmith tracing, supports subgraphs and debate flows, natural extension to multi-modal capabilities, built-in state persistence and checkpointing, mature ecosystem
- Negative: Learning curve for LangGraph-specific concepts, dependency on LangChain ecosystem, potential framework lock-in

## Architecture Overview

### Graph-Based Agent Orchestration

- **StateGraph Design**: Stateful workflow graphs with persistent checkpointing
- **Agent Coordination**: Hierarchical agent relationships with defined roles and capabilities
- **Debate Mechanisms**: 3-agent debate subgraphs (proponent, opponent, moderator) in Phase 1
- **Model Routing**: Dynamic model selection based on task complexity and requirements
- **State Management**: Automatic state synchronization across agent interactions

### Core Orchestration Patterns

- **Conditional Routing**: Dynamic workflow paths based on task analysis and complexity
- **Subgraph Integration**: Modular debate and specialized processing workflows
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Execution time tracking and bottleneck identification

### Agent Role Architecture

- **Task Analyzer**: Complexity assessment and requirement extraction
- **Context Retriever**: GraphRAG+ integration for relevant information gathering
- **Model Router**: Optimal LLM selection based on task characteristics
- **Code Generator**: Primary code production with context awareness
- **Quality Checker**: Output validation and consistency verification
- **Debate Orchestrator**: Multi-agent reasoning for complex decisions

## Phase 2 Extensions

### Extended Agent Configurations

- **5-Agent Debates**: Enhanced reasoning with additional specialist roles (advocate, critic)
- **Multi-Modal Agents**: Vision processing integration for UI/web development
- **Federated Agents**: Privacy-preserving collaboration across distributed nodes
- **Specialized Workflows**: Domain-specific agent configurations (testing, deployment, security)

### Implementation Architecture

```pseudocode
CodeForgeOrchestrator {
  stateGraph: LangGraph.StateGraph
  agentPool: Map<AgentRole, AgentInstance>
  debateEngine: MultiAgentDebate
  modelRouter: DynamicModelSelection
  
  processTask(task) -> Result {
    analysis = analyzeTask(task)
    context = retrieveContext(analysis)
    model = routeModel(analysis.complexity)
    
    if (analysis.requiresDebate) {
      result = runDebate(task, context)
    } else {
      result = generateDirect(task, context, model)
    }
    
    return validateAndFinalize(result)
  }
}

DebateSubgraph {
  participants: [Proponent, Opponent, Moderator]  // Phase 1: 3 agents
  rounds: 2  // Phase 1 default
  consensusThreshold: 0.75
  
  runDebate(proposal) -> Consensus {
    for round in maxRounds {
      arguments = collectArguments(participants)
      synthesis = moderatorAnalysis(arguments)
      if (consensusReached(synthesis)) break
    }
    return finalDecision(synthesis)
  }
}
```
